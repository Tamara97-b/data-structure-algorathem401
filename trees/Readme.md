# Trees
### code challange 15 
### A Tree is a non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.
### Important Terminology in trees
* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
### Approach & Efficiency
add()
Time : O(n).
Space : O(n).
contains()
Time : O(n) in the worst case.
Space : O(1).

### Code Challenge 16
### description
Find the maximum value in a given tree.

### Approach & Efficiency :
In add method I used for loop to find the max value .this is good approch to be used.
Time : O(n).
Space : O(1).

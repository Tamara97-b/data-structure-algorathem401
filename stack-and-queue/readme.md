# Stacks and Queues
### the stack and queue are data structure the properties of stack is LIFO and for queue is FIFO

## Challenge
### implement the stack and queue and use there method enqueue and dequeue and peek and for stak (peek ,pop ,push ) 

## Approach & Efficiency
bigO(1)

## API
* push:adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
* pop:Removes the node from the top of the stack
* peek:Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
* is empty:Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
* enqueue:adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance
* dequeue:Removes the node from the front of the queue
* peek:Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
* is empty:Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty
